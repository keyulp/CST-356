        This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.

        The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. That's crazy. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. Happy painting, God bless. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. A happy cloud. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature.

        Fluff that up. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?
